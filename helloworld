Change to "develop" branch by issuing the "git checkout develop"

Next to enable "feature/myfeaturename" from develop, you need to setup 
first the environment by issuing the the command:  "git flow init"

To setup feature branch, first run from "develop" 
branch "git flow feature start 'myfeaturename'".

To do push new "feature/myfeaturename" branch to github, issue the 
following commands: "git flow feature"
                      (the above will list all feature branches)
                    Then do:
