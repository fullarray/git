***************************
Perfect scenario for git commits. Repository has to be created in Github.com first.
***************************

Run git init. This sets up a local repository in the folder you're in.

Run git remote add [alias] https://github.com/[gitUserName]/[RepoName].git. [alias] can be anything you want. The [alias] is meant to tie to the local repository, so the machine name works well for an [alias]. The URL can be found on github.com, along the top ensure that the HTTP button out of HTTP|SSH|Git Read-Only is clicked. The git:// URL didn't work for me.

Run git pull [alias] master. This will update your local repository and avoid some merging conflicts.

Run git add .

Run git commit -m 'first code commit'

Run git push [alias] master

########## Git Flow #######

Git flow init

git flow feature start "myfeaturename"

[Fill out the prompts on defaults mostly]

git branch "myfeaturename"


git branch
   master
   develop
   feature/myfeaturename

git checkout feature/myfeaturename

[make changes to file, save it]

git commit -am "made changes to file"

[Assuming that "git remote add origin (github.com repo link)"]

git checkout develop

git merge feature/myfeaturename

git push origin develop
