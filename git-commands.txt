-----------------------
Change git user in cli

1 ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your-email-address"

2 Be careful that you don't over-write your existing key for your personal account. Instead, when prompted, save the file as id_rsa_COMPANY. In my case, I've saved the file to ~/.ssh/id_rsa_nettuts

3 Next, login to your second GitHub account, browse to "Account Overview," and attach the new key, within the "SSH Public Keys" section. To retrieve the value of the key that you just created, return to the Terminal, and type: vim ~/.ssh/id_rsa_COMPANY.pub. Copy the entire string that is displayed, and paste this into the GitHub textarea. Feel free to give it any title you wish

4 touch ~/.ssh/config
  vim config

5 Add to config file
  #Default GitHub
  Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
6 Append to config file
  Host github-COMPANY
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_COMPANY

1 git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git

2 git push

3 To ensure that the commits appear as performed by USERNAME, one can setup the user.name and user.email for this project, too:
  git config user.name USERNAME
  git config user.email USERNAME@example.com
